## Abstract
This paper assesses past and future carbonization dynamics in Sub-Sahara Africa. We investigate the evolution of emission changes in the last decades and analyze the underlying drivers.  We show that since 2005 emission growth in Sub-Sahara Africa has mainly been due to the growth of GDP and population. Changes in the carbon intensity play an increasingly important role. These changes have been driven mainly by the rapidly increasing use of oil, i.e. by the transportation sector. Combining investment data in the power sector with economic and population projections, we find that in the near future investments in coal-fired capacities currently planned and under construction can be expected to be a major driver of future carbonization. Our results highlight the importance of making low-carbon technologies available and financially attractive for Sub-Saharan African countries to avoid a lock-in of emission-intensive energy use patterns.

## Description
This repository contains the scripts created to perform a data analysis of carbonization patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa (without South Africa).
